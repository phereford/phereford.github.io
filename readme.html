          <h1>Why Does this Document Exist?</h1>
          <p>
            <strong>Transparency</strong>: Drive understanding of what motivates me, why
            it motivates me and how I go to work for you as your manager.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Alignment</strong>: Achieve a team-based, singular focus on solving
            business issues. Take that focus and apply it to you: how it impacts you,
            your role, and how best I can support you in your personal quest and company
            goals.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Rules of the road</strong>: Give you guidance on how best to approach
            me, communicate with me, ask for help, and core pillars of what teamwork
            means for us.
          </p>

            <h1>What can you expect from me? (Transparency)</h1>
            <p>
              <strong>Positive Attitude</strong>: I strive to create and encourage a happy working
              harmony as a team.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Collaborative</strong>: Solutions in isolation don't benefit from external perspectives. Collaboration makes solutions stronger, better and gives teams
              alignment and purpose.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Present</strong>: No matter the scenario, you will have my undivided attention
              when you need it. No cell phone, no laptop distractions.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Authentic</strong>: I bring my whole self to work. The person you see at the office
              is the same person outside the office.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Consistent</strong>: No matter the scenario or the forum,
              you can be sure that there will be no surprises from me.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Generous</strong>: I will go above and beyond to make sure you have
              everything you need to be successful.

            <h1>Why is Positivity Important?</h1>
            <ul>
              <li>
                I want you to perform at your very best every day. To do that, we need
                a positive environment to work in and that starts with me.
              </li>
              <li>
                Positive work environments foster creativity, innovation and psychological
                safety.
              </li>
              <li>
                You spend most of your awake hours at work. Let's make them fun
                and as gratifying as possible, together!
              </li>
            </ul>

          <section>
            <h1>Why is Collaboration Important?</h1>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The best solutions come from fully integrated, cooperative working
                environments.
              </li>
              <li>
                Collaboration fosters alignment between groups and individuals.
              </li>
              <li>
                Collaboration fosters open environments where ideas are welcomed
                and diversity of thought is promoted.
              </li>

            <h1>Why is being Present Important?</h1>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Every team needs their head to be an active listener and
                present in all conversations.
              </li>
              <li>
                Distractions need to be at a minimum when in meetings or one on
                one interactions. No cell phones, no laptops when possible.
              </li>
              <li>
                Being present helps build trust and authentic relationships
                between individuals.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h1>Why is Authenticity Important?</h1>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Authenticity builds trust. This trust allows the team to build
                bonds and foster safety as initiatives begin.
              </li>
              <li>
                I will always have your best interests at the forefront of my
                conversations and decisions. Without authenticity and trust,
                this is unachievable or unbelievable.
              </li>
              <li>
                Authenticity creates safety that allows others to share their
                ideas and opinions.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h1>Why is Consistency Important?</h1>
            <ul>
              <li>
                There is so much that happens in a day at a company. To create
                efficiencies and increase clarity, consistency in communication
                and decision making are a top priority.
              <li>
                Being consistent reduces uncertainty. This is crucial in building
                psychologically safe environments as uncertainty often breeds
                anxiety.
              </li>
              <li>
                Communication consistency reduces most negative surprises that may occur.
              </li>
              <li>
                Consistency fosters initiative. If you already know my answer
                because of consistency, your question has an answer and can be
                acted upon without unnecessary waiting.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h1>Why is being Generous Important?</h1>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Everyone needs various degrees of help at different times. It is
                important to ensure people know that I am willing to step up
                and help.
              </li>
              <li>
                At the same time, I do my best to ensure I don't overstep
                boundaries. You will always have my full support in doing
                whatever is necessary to make you successful and happy.

          <h1>What do I expect of you? (Alignment)</h1>
          <p><strong>Team First Attitude</strong>: Production systems are touched by so many
          different individuals (business, product, engineering, QA, etc). It is important
          to understand that we all have a role in this system and we are one
          team.</p>
          <p><strong>Honest and Forthcoming</strong>: Outages happen. Bugs happen. Let's focus on learning
          from these mistakes instead of sweeping them under the rug. No punitive actions will happen
          so long as the incident is documented (in third person view) and everyone can
          learn from it.</p>
          <p><strong>Collaborative</strong>: Diversity of thought creates the best,
          robust solutions possible. It is important that we all encourage ideas
          and conversation.</p>

            <h1>Loosely Held "Rules"</h1>
            <ul>
              <li>I deeply believe in "flow" of thought. In open office spaces,
                it is <strong>very</strong> difficult to guard flow. I will do everything
                I can to protect engineering flow. Within our own team, however, it is
                okay to raise a timely issue or an emergency but let's do our best to
                allow team members to concentrate. This  rule does not apply to me.
                Disrupt me at will.
              </li>
              <li>Before asking anyone for help, try to solve your issue for
                a minimum of 15 minutes. When describing what you need help with,
                this gives you a basis as to what you tried.</li>
              <li>
                The sooner you reach out to me with issues, the sooner I go to
                work on a solution for you.
              </li>
              <li>
                I love staff meetings/retrospectives. It is a time for us to get
                together and reflect on issues. Participation is not
                mandatory, but I would love it if you spoke up about problems or
                solutions.
              </li>
              <li>
                I do my best to ensure you have all the tools (laptop, conferences, etc)
                you need to be successful at your job.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h1>Psychological Safety</h1>
            <ul>
              <li>
                In order to innovate, we need to remove some of the stigma
                around failure. Any mistake that happens will not result in
                punitive action on my part. Mistakes are essential to learning
                and growth.
              </li>
              <li>
                Outages and bugs will happen. It is important to document issues
                so others can learn from their peers. We should celebrate these
                events as a means to reduce tension and increase cooperation.
              </li>
              <li>
                I will never second guess or question your ability. You were hired
                here because of your skills. What I will do is continue to push
                you and understand where you want to grow so as to best support
                you.
              </li>
              <li>
                I do my best to create space for people to grow into. These
                spaces are going to be different for everyone as no one person
                has identical interests or career goals.
              </li>
              <li>
                I will <strong>never</strong> criticize you in public. I will
                often praise you in public, but constructive criticism is
                strictly held for one on one interactions.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h1>Authentic Relationships</h1>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Everything we do is predicated on trust. To build trust, we
                have start being authentic with one another.
              </li>
              <li>
                Building authenticity is not just a one time event. It happens
                continuously and can be achieved through
                one-on-ones, staff meetings, collaboration and more.
              </li>
              <li>
                Expect explicit, direct feedback from me during one on one
                sessions. One-on-Ones are my venue to help you grow by providing
                the feedback you need.
              </li>
              <li>
                I don't expect everyone to become friends on the team. I do expect
                a baseline of respect where we can have respectful dialgoue. It's ok
                to be outside of your comfort zone. It is not okay to demean, belittle,
                stereotype, or gaslight a fellow team member.

            This is not an all encompassing document of my core values and
