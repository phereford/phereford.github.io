# Hiring Software Engineers: Tactics and Postings (1/5)
_Note: The thoughts contained in this post are my own through 10+ years of
hiring software engineers. I am not a licensed HR professional.
This is the first in a series[1] that will cover a range of topics for
engineering leaders to consider while hiring software individuals._

Hiring is broken. Companies post jobs online, share them through social
media channels and hope for a deluge of candidates. In reality, unless the company
is [FAANG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook,_Apple,_Amazon,_Netflix_and_Google),
this *NEVER* happens. The competition for individuals in today's hiring landscape
is _fierce_. Unemployment is low and many companies of all industries are
vying for engineers. Couple that with a short supply of engineering talent and we get
a fiercely competitive environment for attracting talent. If you feel this as
a hiring manager in technology, let's discuss some ways you can make yourself
stand out against the competition.  
  
## Tactics
At a bare minimum, there needs to be a job posting online and it needs to be
circulated on various social media channels. If your company has a talent
acquisition department, you need to *PARTNER* with them as engineering
leadership.  
  
Not too long ago Greg, an engineering manager for a team of 5, was tasked with
hiring 10 addtional engineers in a year for a company unknown to most
candidates. Greg understood the nuances of the hiring landscape and delegated
large swatchs of hiring to HR. HR knew how to hire as they just hired 25 new
employees in the last month in a company less than 50! HR did everything they
could for outreach on LinkedIn and StackOverflow but got a 0% response rate in
a month. Greg was astonished and decided to change his tactic. Instead of
delegating, Greg partnered with HR and started owning outreach, messaging and
phone screening of engineers. Low and behold, Greg achieved an 80% response
rate while reaching out to the same number of candidates.  
  
In the above anecdote, Greg uncovered something very interesting. Engineers
respond _much better_ to other engineers! Let's posit some hypotheses as to why
this may be:
1) Engineers have reruiter fatigue from constantly being solicited across various
channels. It is sad to say but HR and talent acquisition are put into the same
bucket as recruiters.
2) Engineers respond better to other engineers because they feel their time is
valued.  
3) Engineers respond to "higher ranking" engineers in attempts to potentially
learn something.
4) Incentives from different parties alter the conversation significantly.

Thinking about my own behaviors, I have realized that I ignore most recruiter
communication unless I have an existing relationship with that recruiter. On the
flip side, I respond to every CTO that reaches out to me. My rationale in that
is solely due to incentive alignment. The CTO is taking time out of their busy
schedule to talk to me whereas it is a recruiters/HR's job to do this outreach.
From the CTO, I would expect to get an unfiltered view of engineering and their
place in the organization where I would not get that perspective from HR or the
recruiter. HR/Recruiters are incentivized to paint a picture perfect
representation of the company. I feel this as recruiters are paid by placement
and HR generally has incentivization around hiring. CTOs have a wide array of
incentives of which hiring may be one piece but is dwarfed by other incentives.  
  
Given these hypotheses, it is highly recommended to have engineering hiring 
managers employ tactics that involves outreach and initial phone screens.
This tactic will drastically improve the top of your hiring pipeline and have
an impact on the perceived value from the candidate. Engineering hiring managers
need to effectively partner with HR to ensure a healthy candidate pipeline and
provide value for the candidates. While hiring is intense these days, if a
candidate walks away from interactions and feels either that their time was
valued or they received knowledge or value in your interactions with them, then
you have drastically increased your chances in having them progress in your
hiring pipeline.

## Posting Essentials
Outreach and phone screens are helpful in engaging with potential candidates.
Prior to these efforts, you need to get them into your pipeline. This is where
your job posting will help attract the candidates you desire. Here are five
essentials[2] to include in your post.  

### 1. Measure Impact, Not Years of Experience
Imagine the following scenario:  
1) Tim, an engineer with 10 years experience, has focused on one single aspect
of a platform and fine tuned every aspect of that system regardless of the cost
or benefit. The company Tim works for can afford this as they have 100s of
engineers that are highly specialized and focused on these tasks.
2) Ben, an engineering with 5 years experience, worked on high impact projects
like internal automation systems, automated payment systems and more. Ben claims
that his systems increased the business by 500% within one year and another 200%
within his last two years.  
  
Which of the two engineers above would you prefer to hire? _It absolutely depends
on the role in question._ Tim is an absolute expert in X, one of a handful. If
you have that need in your organization, you hire Tim! Every other scenario that
does not involve Tim's expertise, Ben would probably be the right choice. Ben
has a proven track record of increasing business value by some nominal value. At
the end of the day, we are looking for a combination of expertise and business
value.

### 2. Include Personal Qualities Needed for Success
Every company values different qualities for different roles. The values needed
to be successful as a C-Suite individual compared to a Sales Rep are different.
It is absolutely critical that these are shared in a job posting so candidates
can fully understand what it would take to be successful at your company.  
  
As an example when I was hiring, I generally included empathy as a quality
needed for engineers. My reasoning was that we need engineers to be problem
solvers of the highest degree. In order to achieve this, we need engineers to
fully understand the problems they are solving. Given that most problems are
customer (internal or external) centric, you need your engineers to empathize
with the customer and eventually prescribe a solution. Without the empathy, it
would just be another task on their JIRA board that never gets completed. In
addition, empathy among engineers helps with process building, code review,
mentoring and so much more.
  
Regardless of what those qualities are, your metrics of success for the role
need to be distilled down to personal qualities that will help potential
employees achieve success.  

### 3. Succinctly Describe the Company
There are so many companies out there, competing against one another for the
same talent. Not everyone will know what your company does and as such, a
brief description about the company needs to be present in the posting. You
should not allocate more than a paragraph to this as it is less important than
the role itself. Your pool of candidates will probably skim this section to
understand industry, culture and a few other  items.

### 4. Describe the Process Involved
One of the murkiest parts of hiring is the actual hiring process. Is it 4 people
I have to speak with over 2 days? Or is it 4 days? Is there a whiteboarding
exercise? Come on, everyone dislikes whiteboarding right?  
  
Detailing your process will help align individuals that apply and increase your
qualified pool of candidates. You would be surprised how many people will drop
out during your whiteboarding exercise. Instead of spending all the time to get
to that point on someone who will 100% drop out, they should self select at
time of looking at the job posting. An exemplary example of this is
[Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/hiring/interviewing/). They have this
amazing detailed document dedicated to talking about their process and even
embed a small snippet about timelines on a specific post like the below block:  
```
Hiring Process
Applicants for this position can expect the hiring process to follow the order below. Please keep in mind that applicants can be declined from the position at any stage of the process. To learn more about someone who may be conducting the interview, find her/his job title on our team page.
 
 - Selected candidates will be invited to schedule a 30 minute screening call with our Recruiting team

```  
  
This is exactly what someone needs to know so as to go about their interview
process!

### 5. Include a Salary Range
This is hotly contested in hiring circles these days. The rationale is that
anyone performing outreach and phone screens need to ensure the time spent on
these activies are high value touchpoints. High value
in this scenario means that the candidates being reached out to or being
screened are _qualified_ candidates. Without including a salary range,
candidates in your pipeline are not fully qualified as they might be too
expensive for your company.
  
Let's be respectful of _everyones_ time and include a salary range.
  
## Summary  
Engineering hiring managers need to optimize their job postings to obtain as many
qualified candidates as possible. In addition, engineering hiring managers need
to effectively partner with HR and own outreach and phone screens. Generally
speaking, due to incentives and other industry nuanaces, candidates respond
better when speaking with other technical individuals.
