## Five Year Recap
It has been almost five years since I have written any content. While I am still
building teams and engineering stuff, my focus has really been on career and
family. I have learned much in this time frame as a father, as husband, a
professional, and an individual.

I want to share my professional learnings with other individuals that are making
similar career strides, which is why I am rebooting this blog and will be
creating content on a weekly basis. My hope is that I can help other
professionals increase their leadership toolset to help them with any situation
that may arise.

I am looking forward to this journey! Let's get started!
