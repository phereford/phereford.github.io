This book helps you understand what moments are and gives you the necessary tools
to create moments in life. It illustrates the power of moments through anecdotes that
range from a popsicle hotline in California to sanitization in a remote village.

pride, insight and connection.

John Doerr takes you through amazing anecdotes about several companies that

specific OKRs from companies and concludes with how those OKRs enforced the
company to "stretch" and reach their overly ambitious goals. The companies
